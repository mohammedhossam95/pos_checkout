# pos_checkout_core

A new Flutter project.

Note: This is my first time writing unit tests and using the bloc_test library. I researched it and used some tools to help generate the test files, which allowed me to speed up the process as much as possible.

## Getting Started
Environment: sdk: ^3.7.0


## âœ… Features

- BLoC-based `CatalogBloc` and `CartBloc`
- Immutable state using `equatable`
- Full VAT + discount logic (15% VAT)
- Receipt generation as pure function
- Fully unit-tested with `bloc_test` and `flutter_test`
